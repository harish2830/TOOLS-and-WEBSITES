# Websites 

###Shodan.io

Shodan is also a search engine, but one designed specifically for IoT devices. It scours the invisible parts of the Internet most people won’t ever see. Any connected device can show up in a search, including:server, printers, webcams, traffic lights, security camaras and control systems etc...,

#####Shodan works under 3 steps 
a. The Algorithm
b. The Service Banner
c. The ports

# The Algorithm

   > Generate a random IPv4 address.
   > Collect a real-time list of connected devices online.
   > Query a supported port.
   > Check the IPv4 address on the port.
   > Grab a service banner.
   > Repeat.

# The Service Banner
Service banners contain all the metadata related to a specific device.

   > Geographic location
   > Default username and passwords
   > IP address
   > Software version
   > Make and model

   # The Ports

 With just a quick search or scan on Port numbers, you can explore the wider lot and spot key vulnerabilities in connected devices.
   > Port 554 – Real Time Streaming Protocol
   > Port 5060 – SIP
   > Port 25 – SMTP
   > Port 161 – SNMP
   > Port 23 – Telnet
   > Port 993 – IMAP
   > Port 22 – SSH
   > Port 21 – FTP
   > Ports 8443, 443, 8080, and 80 – HTTPS/HTTP
