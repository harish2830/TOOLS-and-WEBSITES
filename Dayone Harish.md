# Websites 

### Shodan.io

Shodan is also a search engine, but one designed specifically for IoT devices. It scours the invisible parts of the Internet most people won’t ever see. Any connected device can show up in a search, including:server, printers, webcams, traffic lights, security camaras and control systems etc...,

#####Shodan works under 3 steps 
a. The Algorithm
b. The Service Banner
c. The ports

 The Algorithm

   1. Generate a random IPv4 address.
   2. Collect a real-time list of connected devices online.
   3. Query a supported port.
   4. Check the IPv4 address on the port.
   5. Grab a service banner.
   6. Repeat.

 The Service Banner
Service banners contain all the metadata related to a specific device.

   1. Geographic location
   2. Default username and passwords
   3. IP address
   4. Software version
   5. Make and model

    The Ports

 With just a quick search or scan on Port numbers, you can explore the wider lot and spot key vulnerabilities in connected devices.
   1. Port 554 – Real Time Streaming Protocol
   2. Port 5060 – SIP
   3. Port 25 – SMTP
   4. Port 161 – SNMP
   5. Port 23 – Telnet
   6. Port 993 – IMAP
   7. Port 22 – SSH
   8. Port 21 – FTP
